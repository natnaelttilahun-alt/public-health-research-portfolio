# public-health-research-portfolio# Public Health Research Portfolio – Dr. Natnael Tsegaye

This repository showcases sample quantitative and data-management workflows relevant to
global health, maternal and child health (MCH), and surveillance research in LMIC settings.

The scripts reflect skills developed through:
- COVID-19 National Serosurvey (Ohio State Global One Health)
- Lancet MCH & Surgical Center coordination
- Clinical work in neonatal and pediatric care
- Ongoing SQL for Data Analysis training (Coursera)

⚠️ All datasets used here are simulated (dummy data) for demonstration purposes only.

## Tools Demonstrated
- R: data cleaning, descriptive statistics, regression modeling
- Stata: epidemiologic analysis and reporting
- SQL: querying and summarizing health datasets
- Public health focus: perinatal outcomes, surveillance, MCH indicators

## Folder Structure
- `/R-analysis` – quantitative analysis scripts
- `/SQL` – health database queries
- `/Stata` – epidemiologic analysis examples
