# Public Health Research Portfolio – Dr. Natnael Tsegaye

This repository contains sample analytical workflows relevant to global health,
maternal and child health (MCH), and epidemiologic research in low- and middle-income settings.

The scripts demonstrate practical use of:
- R for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis
- Stata for epidemiologic modeling and reporting
- SQL concepts (training in progress) for structured health data querying

The work reflects experience gained through:
- COVID-19 National Serosurvey (Ohio State Global One Health)
- Coordination work at Lancet MCH & Surgical Center
- Clinical and supervisory experience in neonatal and pediatric care

⚠️ All datasets used in this repository are simulated (dummy data) and do not contain
any real patient information.

## Repository Structure
- `R-analysis/` – Quantitative analysis scripts (R)
- `Stata/` – Epidemiologic analysis examples (Stata)
- `SQL/` – Example health data queries (training in progress)
